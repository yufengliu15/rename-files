# Rename Files
Given a directory, rename all files that contain a certain string and replaces said string with a given string. Useful for mass renaming. 

## Objectives:

- Learn more about the git process.

Notice how the redundant strings mask the importance of the file names.

After using rename-files, the files are much clearer to read and understand, while only taking a fraction of the time comparing to manual editing.
